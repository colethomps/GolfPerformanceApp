## Golf Performance Tracking App
Introduction
This README outlines the concept and structure of a mobile app designed to help golf enthusiasts track their performance on the golf course. The primary aim of this app is to provide insights into a player's strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to make data-driven improvements in their game.

The main inspiration for this was 1. https://github.com/mattDavo/masters-shotlink/tree/master and 2. https://shotlink.com/

**About the Project**
As a data engineer and analyst, I am embarking on the journey of creating this golf performance tracking app to not only enhance my data engineering skills but also to provide a useful tool for golfers. This app will capture and analyze shot data to offer valuable statistics, ultimately improving the player's performance on the golf course.

**App Features**
**Data Storage**
To store and manage golf performance data, the app employs a database system. Initially, the choice is SQLite, a lightweight relational database ideal for mobile applications. The data model includes tables for rounds, holes, shots, and yardages, each equipped with attributes to capture essential information.

**User Interface (UI/UX)**
The user interface (UI) of the app is designed for a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Python frameworks like Kivy or Tkinter are used to create screens for entering round data, viewing statistics, and other functionalities. The goal is to make the app accessible and efficient for golfers to interact with.

**Shot Mapping**
One of the app's key features is shot mapping. Users can manually input shot locations by tapping on a picture of each hole. This interactive mapping feature is designed to be user-friendly, enabling players to plot the exact location of each shot on a hole.

**Calculation and Analysis**
Python is used for in-depth analysis of the captured data. The app calculates statistics such as average misses on each hole, average distances, and shot deviations. Libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib are employed to assist with these calculations and to create visual representations of the data.

**Manual Input**
To provide flexibility, the app includes an input form where users can manually enter yardages for each shot. This manual input process is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, allowing users to input data with ease.

**Future Development and Learning**
The app is built with the intention of continual improvement and learning. As the project evolves, there is room to implement more advanced data engineering techniques. This might include migrating to a more robust database system like PostgreSQL to accommodate larger datasets and automated data entry features for efficiency.

**Data Security and Backup**
Data security is a consideration, especially if the app stores sensitive information. Regular data backups ensure that valuable data is not lost in case of unforeseen issues.

**Conclusion**
The golf performance tracking app is a personal project with the goal of honing data engineering and analysis skills while delivering a valuable tool for golfers to track their performance. Continuous improvement, user feedback, and learning are at the core of this project. Whether you're an avid golfer or a data enthusiast, this app aims to provide insights and enhance the game. Enjoy tracking your golf performance!
